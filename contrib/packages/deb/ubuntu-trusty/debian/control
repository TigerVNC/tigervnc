Description: virtual network computing server software
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which allows you to
 view and interact with a virtual desktop environment that is running on another
 computer on the network.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a
 remote machine and send only the display from these applications to your local
 machine.  VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating
 systems and architectures as both servers and clients.
 .
 TigerVNC is a high-speed version of VNC based on the RealVNC 4 and X.org code
 bases.  TigerVNC started as a next-generation development effort for TightVNC
 on Unix and Linux platforms, but it split from its parent project in early 2009
 so that TightVNC could focus on Windows platforms.  TigerVNC supports a variant
 of Tight encoding that is greatly accelerated by the use of the libjpeg-turbo
 JPEG codec.
