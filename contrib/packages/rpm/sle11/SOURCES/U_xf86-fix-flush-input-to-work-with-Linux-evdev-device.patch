Subject: [PATCH] xf86: fix flush input to work with Linux evdev devices.

So when we VT switch back and attempt to flush the input devices,
we don't succeed because evdev won't return part of an event,
since we were only asking for 4 bytes, we'd only get -EINVAL back.

This could later cause events to be flushed that we shouldn't have
gotten.

This is a fix for CVE-2013-1940.
