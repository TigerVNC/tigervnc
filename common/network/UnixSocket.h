// -=- UnixSocket.h - base-class for UNIX stream sockets.
//     This header also defines the UnixListener class, used
//     to listen for incoming socket connections over UNIX
//
//     NB: Any file descriptors created by the UnixSocket or
//     UnixListener classes are close-on-exec if the OS supports
//     it.  UnixSockets initialised with a caller-supplied fd
//     are NOT set to close-on-exec.
