// rdr::MemInStream is an InStream which streams from a given memory buffer.
// If the deleteWhenDone parameter is true then the buffer will be delete[]d in
// the destructor.  Note that it is delete[]d as a U8* - strictly speaking this
// means it ought to be new[]ed as a U8* as well, but on most platforms this
// doesn't matter.
