// Blacklist.h - Handling of black-listed entities.
// Just keeps a table mapping strings to timing information, including
// how many times the entry has been black-listed and when to next
// put it on probation (e.g. allow a connection in from the host, and
// re-blacklist it if that fails).

  //
  // -=- Blacklist handler
  //
  // Parameters include a threshold after which to blacklist the named
  // host, and a timeout after which to re-consider them.
  //
  // Threshold means that isBlackmarked can be called that number of times
  // before it will return true.
  //
  // Timeout means that after that many seconds, the next call to isBlackmarked
  // will return false.  At the same time, the timeout is doubled, so that the
  // next calls will fail, until the timeout expires again or clearBlackmark is
  // called.
  //
  // When clearBlackMark is called, the corresponding entry is completely
  // removed, causing the next isBlackmarked call to return false.

  // KNOWN BUG:  Client can keep making rejected requests, thus increasing
  // their timeout.  If client does this for 30 years, timeout may wrap round
  // to a very small value again.

  // THIS CLASS IS NOT THREAD-SAFE!
