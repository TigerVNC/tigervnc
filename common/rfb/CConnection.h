    // which we are connected.  This might be the result of getPeerEndpoint on
    // a TcpSocket, for example, or a host specified by DNS name & port.
    // The serverName is used when verifying the Identity of a host (see RA2).

    // setStreams() sets the streams to be used for the connection.  These must
    // be set before initialiseProtocol() and processMsg() are called.  The
    // CSecurity object may call setStreams() again to provide alternative
    // streams over which the RFB protocol is sent (i.e. encrypting/decrypting
    // streams).  Ownership of the streams remains with the caller
    // (i.e. SConnection will not delete them).

    // PixelBuffer to delete the previous one.

    //   to handle. e.g. if data is encrypted.

    // - data available on the CConnection's current InStream

    //   message before returning.
