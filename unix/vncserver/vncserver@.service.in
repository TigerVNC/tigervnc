# The vncserver service unit file
#
# Quick HowTo:
# 1. Add a user mapping to @CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_SYSCONFDIR@/tigervnc/vncserver.users.
# 2. Adjust the global or user configuration. See the
#    vncsession(8) manpage for details. (OPTIONAL)
# 3. Run `systemctl enable vncserver@:<display>.service`
# 4. Run `systemctl start vncserver@:<display>.service`
#
# DO NOT RUN THIS SERVICE if your local area network is
# untrusted!  For a secure way of using VNC, you should
# limit connections to the local host and then tunnel from
# the machine you want to view VNC on (host A) to the machine
# whose VNC output you want to view (host B)
#
# [user@hostA ~]$ ssh -v -C -L 590N:localhost:590M hostB
#
# this will open a connection on port 590N of your hostA to hostB's port 590M
# (in fact, it ssh-connects to hostB and then connects to localhost (on hostB).
# See the ssh man page for details on port forwarding)
#
# You can then point a VNC client on hostA at vncdisplay N of localhost and with
# the help of ssh, you end up seeing what hostB makes available on port 590M
#
# Use "nolisten=tcp" to prevent X connections to your VNC server via TCP.
#
# Use "localhost" to prevent remote VNC clients connecting except when
# doing so through a secure tunnel.  See the "-via" option in the
# `man vncviewer' manual page.
