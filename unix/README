There are six programs here:

  vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for X.

  Xvnc - this is the X VNC server - it is both a VNC server and an X server
         with a "virtual" framebuffer.  You normally use the vncserver script
         to start Xvnc.

  vncserver - this is a wrapper script which makes starting an X VNC server
              (i.e. desktop) more convenient.  It is written in Perl, so to use
              the script you need that.

  vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to access
              your X VNC desktops.  The vncserver script uses this program when
              you first start a VNC server.

  vncconfig - this program is used to configure and control a running instance
              of Xvnc.

  x0vncserver - this is an inefficient VNC server which continuously polls any
                X display, allowing it to be controlled via VNC.  It is
                intended mainly as a demonstration of a simple VNC server.

In addition to these standalone programs, this distribution can also
be used to turn the native X server for a platform into a VNC server.
For X.Org servers, this is done using a module loaded at run-time.
For other X servers it requires replacing the native X server binary.

To build this distribution you need a C++ compiler as well as a C compiler.
You also need a reasonably recent version of the X window system installed.
This comes as standard with most unix machines.  If you don't have it
installed, see http://www.x.org. 

To build everything but Xvnc, do:

  % ./configure
  % make

This should build first some libraries - zlib, jpeg, rdr, network, Xregion, rfb
and tx - then vncviewer, vncconfig and vncpasswd.  System zlib and jpeg are
preferred. If you want use zlib and jpeg distributed with TightVNC you have to
run configure "./configure --with-tight-zlib --with-tight-jpeg".

Building Xvnc
=============

Building Xvnc and the VNC support for native X servers is much more complex.
If you don't need to build it, skip to the section below on installing.

Xvnc differs from the other programs in that it is built inside the X source
tree.  Unlike previous versions of Xvnc, we do not provide an X source tree
with this distribution.  We have designed the distribution to be as independent
as possible of the X tree used.

We have successfully used X.Org 7.4.99.901, (available from http://www.x.org/).
Note that the X tree is enormous and notoriously difficult to deal with -
building it is not for the faint-hearted!

You have to install many additional things like GNU build system tools and many
libraries needed by X server

First you have to download X source:

  % git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/xserver xorg
  % cd xorg
  % git checkout origin/server-1.5-branch

Once you have a copy of the X source tree, copy it to vnc source tree

  % cp -r xorg/* <path_to_tightvnc_source>/unix/xserver

Then you have to apply a patch to some files in the X source tree:

  % cd <path_to_tightvnc_source>/unix/xserver
  % patch -p1 < ../xserver15.patch

- note: you can use server-1.6-branch. Simply checkout it as written above
  and use xserver16.patch

After that you have to regenerate configure script and Makefile.in:

  % autoreconf -fiv

Next step is run configure script. It is very difficult use correct parameters.
You should use same parameters as used in your distribution X server and add
--disable-xvfb --disable-xnest --disable-xorg:

  % ./configure <dist_X_flags> --disable-xvfb --disable-xnest --disable-xorg

If this works, you should be able to build the entire X tree, including Xvnc:

  % make

This will take a long time, and will quite probably fail for one reason or
another!  If you are having trouble, we suggest you try to build the X tree in
isolation first before attempting it with the VNC additions.

If successful, in the hw/vnc directory you should find an Xvnc and libvnc
module.

Exactly which X extensions and features are built into Xvnc and the native X
server binary is determined by configure parameters. Run ./configure --help for
more information.

Installing
==========

Different unix platforms have different conventions for where software should
be installed.  To copy the programs to some directory which is in your PATH
environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin you can use Makefile variables. In
<tightvnc>/unix subdirectory run:

  % make install bindir=/usr/local/bin mandir=/usr/local/man

It will also try to install the Xvnc and vnc.so X.Org module if appropriate.
Both can be installed when you run:

  % make install bindir=/usr/local/bin mandir=/usr/local/man

in <tightvnc>/unix/xserver subdirectory

Module can be enabled like any other module by adding a Load "vnc" line to
the Module section of xorg.conf.  The parameters listed in the Xvnc manual
page can be set as options in xorg.conf e.g.

Option "passwordFile" "/root/.vnc/passwd".

Note that for some reason options cannot be set in the Module section of
xorg.conf - try the Screen section.

If you want to use the Java VNC viewer, you should copy the files from
the java directory to some suitable installation directory such as
/usr/local/vnc/classes:

  % mkdir -p /usr/local/vnc/classes
  % cp ../common/javabin/* /usr/local/vnc/classes

We recommend that you use the vncserver script to run Xvnc for you.  You can
edit the script as appropriate for your site.  Things you may need to change
include:

 * The location of Perl - if Perl is not installed in /usr/bin you'll need
   to edit the "#!/usr/bin/perl" first line of vncserver.

 * Xvnc's font path and color database.  If you have an installation of
   X which is not in the standard place you may need to add arguments to the
   Xvnc command line to set these.  These should be appended to the $cmd
   variable at the comment "# Add font path and color database...".

 * $vncJavaFiles - this specifies the location of the files for
   the VNC viewer Java applet.  The default is /usr/local/vnc/classes.
