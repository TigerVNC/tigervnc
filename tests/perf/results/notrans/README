This directory contains the test results in preparation for the removal
of the PixelTransformer class.

Tests were performed on Linux with these CPUs:

 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
 - ARM i.MX6 DualLite @ 1 GHz

The tests show that the new bufferFromBuffer() has similar performance
as PixelTransformer in most cases. It gets beaten in two cases:

 - Input format is 16 BPP and PixelTransformer is in the
   non-economical mode (the default mode).

 - Input format is 8 BPP, mode irrelevant.

PixelTransformer is about twice as fast in both these cases (more if
converting between two low colour formats).

Although this is significant, it is in cases that are already difficult
to deal with performance wise, and exceedingly rare with modern
hardware. As such it is difficult to motivate the extra complexity that
PixelTransformer requires.

If it turns out that these cases are significant, than we can move
PixelTransformer's massive lookup tables into a shared cache in
PixelFormat. Implementation complexity would be similar, but at least
we would have a friendly API.
