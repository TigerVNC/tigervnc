 * Lets create a simple finite-state machine for 3 button emulation:
 *
 * We track buttons 1 and 3 (left and right).  There are 11 states:
 *   0 ground           - initial state
 *   1 delayed left     - left pressed, waiting for right
 *   2 delayed right    - right pressed, waiting for left
 *   3 pressed middle   - right and left pressed, emulated middle sent
 *   4 pressed left     - left pressed and sent
 *   5 pressed right    - right pressed and sent
 *   6 released left    - left released after emulated middle
 *   7 released right   - right released after emulated middle
 *   8 repressed left   - left pressed after released left
 *   9 repressed right  - right pressed after released right
 *  10 pressed both     - both pressed, not emulating middle
 *
 * At each state, we need handlers for the following events
 *   0: no buttons down
 *   1: left button down
 *   2: right button down
 *   3: both buttons down
 *   4: emulate3Timeout passed without a button change
 * Note that button events are not deltas, they are the set of buttons being
 * pressed now.  It's possible (ie, mouse hardware does it) to go from (eg)
 * left down to right down without anything in between, so all cases must be
 * handled.
 *
 * a handler consists of three values:
 *   0: action1
 *   1: action2
 *   2: new emulation state
 *
 * action > 0: ButtonPress
 * action = 0: nothing
 * action < 0: ButtonRelease
 *
 * The comment preceeding each section is the current emulation state.
 * The comments to the right are of the form
 *      <button state> (<events>) -> <new emulation state>
 * which should be read as
 *      If the buttons are in <button state>, generate <events> then go to
 *      <new emulation state>.
