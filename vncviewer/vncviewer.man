.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vncviewer
is a viewer (client) for Virtual Network Computing.  This manual page documents
version 4 for the X window system.

If you run the viewer with no arguments it will prompt you for a VNC server to
connect to.  Alternatively, specify the VNC server as an argument, e.g.:

.RS
vncviewer snoopy:2
.RE

where 'snoopy' is the name of the machine, and '2' is the display number of the
VNC server on that machine.  Either the machine name or display number can be
omitted.  So for example ":1" means display number 1 on the same machine, and
"snoopy" means "snoopy:0" i.e. display 0 on machine "snoopy".

As another quick way to start a connection to a VNC server, specify a .tigervnc
configuration file as an argument to the viewer, e.g.:

.RS
vncviewer ./some.tigervnc
.RE

where './some.tigervnc' is an existing and valid TigerVNC configuration file.
The file name needs to include a path separator.  Additional options may be
given too, but the given configuration file will overwrite any conflicting
parameters.

If the VNC server is successfully contacted, you will be prompted for a
password to authenticate you. You can also add 'VNC_USERNAME' and 'VNC_PASSWORD'
to environment variables. If the password is correct, a window will appear
showing the desktop of the VNC server.

.SH AUTOMATIC PROTOCOL SELECTION

The viewer tests the speed of the connection to the server and chooses the
encoding and pixel format (color level) appropriately.  This makes it much
easier to use than previous versions where the user had to specify arcane
command line arguments.

The viewer normally starts out assuming the link is slow, using the
encoding with the best compression.  If it turns out that the link is
fast enough it switches to an encoding which compresses less but is
faster to generate, thus improving the interactive feel.

The viewer normally starts in full-color mode, but switches to
low-color mode if the bandwidth is insufficient. However, this only
occurs when communicating with servers supporting protocol 3.8 or
newer, since many old servers do not support color mode changes
safely.

Automatic selection can be turned off by setting the
\fBAutoSelect\fP parameter to false, or from the options dialog.

.SH KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

The viewer can be controlled using certain key combinations, invoking
special actions instead of passing the keyboard events on to the remote
session. By default pressing Ctrl+Alt and something else will be
interpreted as a keyboard shortcut for the viewer, but this can be
changed witht the \fBShortcutModifiers\fP parameter.

The possible keyboard shortcuts are:

.TP
Ctrl+Alt
Releases control of the keyboard and allows system keys to be used
locally.
.
.TP
Ctrl+Alt+G
Grabs control of the keyboard and allows system keys (like Alt+Tab) to
be sent to the remote session.
.
.TP
Ctrl+Alt+Enter
Toggles full-screen mode.
.
.TP
Ctrl+Alt+M
Opens a popup menu that can perform various extra actions, such as
quitting the viewer or opening the options dialog.
.
.TP
Ctrl+Alt+Space
Temporarily bypasses the keyboard shortcuts, allowing the same key
combinations to be sent to the remote session.
.

.SH FULL-SCREEN MODE
A full-screen mode is supported.  This is particularly useful when connecting
to a remote screen which is the same size as your local one. If the remote
screen is bigger, you can scroll by bumping the mouse against the edge of the
screen.

.SH OPTIONS (PARAMETERS)
You can get a list of parameters by giving \fB\-h\fP as a command-line option
to vncviewer.  Parameters can be turned on with -\fIparam\fP or off with
-\fIparam\fP=0.  Parameters which take a value can be specified as
-\fIparam\fP \fIvalue\fP.  Other valid forms are \fIparam\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
-\fIparam\fP=\fIvalue\fP --\fIparam\fP=\fIvalue\fP.  Parameter names are
case-insensitive.

Many of the parameters can also be set graphically via the options dialog box.
This can be accessed from the popup menu or from the "Connection details"
dialog box.

.
.TP
.B \-AutoSelect
Use automatic selection of encoding and pixel format (default is on).  Normally
the viewer tests the speed of the connection to the server and chooses the
encoding and pixel format appropriately.  Turn it off with \fB-AutoSelect=0\fP.
.
.TP
.B \-CompressLevel \fIlevel\fP
Use specified lossless compression level. 0 = Low, 9 = High. Default is 2.

either "Dot", or "System". Ignored if AlwaysCursor is off.
The default is "Dot".
.
.TP
.B \-CustomCompressLevel
Use custom compression level. Default if \fBCompressLevel\fP is specified.
.
.TP
.B \-DesktopSize \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
Instead of keeping the existing remote screen size, the client will attempt to
switch to the specified since when connecting. If the server does not support
the SetDesktopSize message then the screen will retain the original size.
.
.TP
.B \-display \fIXdisplay\fP
Specifies the X display on which the TigerVNC window should appear.
.
.TP
.B \-DotWhenNoCursor (DEPRECATED)
Show the dot cursor when the server sends an invisible cursor. Replaced by
\fB-AlwaysCursor\fP and \fB-CursorType=Dot\fP
.
.TP
.B \-EmulateMiddleButton
Emulate middle mouse button by pressing left and right mouse buttons
simultaneously. Default is off.
.
.TP
.B \-FullColor, \-FullColour
Tells the VNC server to send full-color pixels in the best format for this
display.  This is default.
.
.TP
.B \-FullScreen
Start in full-screen mode.
.
.TP
.B \-FullScreenAllMonitors (DEPRECATED)
Use all local monitors and not just the current one when switching to
full-screen mode. Replaced by \fB-FullScreenMode=all\fP
.
.TP
.B \-FullScreenMode \fImode\fP
Specify which monitors to use when in full screen. It should be either "Current",
"Selected" (specified by \fB-FullScreenSelectedMonitors\fP) or "All".
The default is "Current".
.
.TP
.B \-FullScreenSelectedMonitors \fImonitors\fP
This option specifies the monitors to use with \fB-FullScreenMode=selected\fP.
Monitors are ordered according to the system configuration from left to right,
and in case of a conflict, from top to bottom. So, for example, "1,2,3" means
that the first, second and third monitor counting from the left should be used.
The default is "1".
.
.TP
.B \-FullscreenSystemKeys
Automatically grab all input from the keyboard when entering full-screen
and pass special keys (like Alt+Tab) directly to the server.
.
.TP
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
Initial position of the main TigerVNC window. The format is
.B \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP+\fIxoffset\fP+\fIyoffset\fP
, where `+' signs can be replaced with `\-' signs to specify offsets from the
right and/or from the bottom of the screen.  Offsets are optional and the
window will be placed by the window manager by default.
.
.TP
.B \-GnuTLSPriority \fIpriority\fP
GnuTLS priority string that controls the TLS sessionâ€™s handshake algorithms.
See the GnuTLS manual for possible values. Default is \fBNORMAL\fP.
.
.TP
.B \-listen \fI[port]\fP
Causes vncviewer to listen on the given port (default 5500) for reverse
connections from a VNC server.  WinVNC supports reverse connections initiated
using the 'Add new client' menu option or the '\-connect' command-line option.
Xvnc supports reverse connections with a helper program called
.B vncconfig.
.
.TP
.B \-Log \fIlogname\fP:\fIdest\fP:\fIlevel\fP[, ...]
Configures the debug log settings.  \fIdest\fP can currently be \fBstderr\fP or
\fBstdout\fP, and \fIlevel\fP is between 0 and 100, 100 meaning most verbose
output.  \fIlogname\fP is usually \fB*\fP meaning all, but you can target a
specific source file if you know the name of its "LogWriter".  Default is
\fB*:stderr:30\fP.
.
.TP
.B \-LowColorLevel, \-LowColourLevel \fIlevel\fP
Selects the reduced color level to use on slow links.  \fIlevel\fP can range

\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/passwd\fP, or \fI~/.config/tigervnc/passwd\fP
if the former is unset.
.
.TP
.B \-PointerEventInterval \fItime\fP
Time in milliseconds to rate-limit successive pointer events. Default is
17 ms (60 Hz).

.TP
\fB\-via\fR \fIgateway\fR
Automatically create encrypted TCP tunnel to the \fIgateway\fR machine
before connection, connect to the \fIhost\fR through that tunnel
(TigerVNC\-specific). By default, this option invokes SSH local port
forwarding, assuming that SSH client binary can be accessed as
/usr/bin/ssh. Note that when using the \fB\-via\fR option, the host
machine name should be specified as known to the gateway machine, e.g.
"localhost" denotes the \fIgateway\fR, not the machine where vncviewer
was launched. The environment variable \fIVNC_VIA_CMD\fR can override
the default tunnel command of
\fB/usr/bin/ssh\ \-f\ \-L\ "$L":"$H":"$R"\ "$G"\ sleep\ 20\fR.  The tunnel
command is executed with the environment variables \fIL\fR, \fIH\fR,
\fIR\fR, and \fIG\fR taking the values of the local port number, the remote
host, the port number on the remote host, and the gateway machine
respectively.
.
.TP
.B \-ViewOnly
Specifies that no keyboard or mouse events should be sent to the server.
Useful if you want to view a desktop without interfering; often needs to be
combined with
.B \-Shared.
.
.TP
.B \-X509CA \fIpath\fP
Path to CA certificate to use when authenticating remote servers using any
of the X509 security schemes (X509None, X509Vnc, etc.). Must be in PEM
format. Default is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/x509_ca.pem\fP, or
\fI~/.config/tigervnc/x509_ca.pem\fP.
.
.TP
.B \-X509CRL \fIpath\fP
Path to certificate revocation list to use in conjunction with
\fB-X509CA\fP. Must also be in PEM format. Default is
