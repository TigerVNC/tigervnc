// -=- WMShatter.h
//
// WMShatter provides the IsSafeWM routine, which returns true iff the
// supplied window message is safe to pass to DispatchMessage, or to
// process in the window procedure.
//
// This is only required, of course, to avoid so-called "shatter" attacks
// to be made against the VNC server, which take advantage of the noddy
// design of the Win32 window messaging system.
//
// The API here is designed to hopefully be future proof, so that if they
// ever come up with a proper way to determine whether a message is safe
// or not then it can just be reimplemented here...
