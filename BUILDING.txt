**     Building on Unix Platforms (including Cygwin)
*******************************************************************************


==================
Build Requirements
==================

-- X11 development kit

-- If building TLS support:
   * GnuTLS and its dependencies (libgcrypt, libtasn1, libgpg-error)

-- If building Xvnc:
   * Python v2.3 or later
   * zlib v1.2 or later
   * OpenSSL v0.9.7 or later

   * pkgconfig 0.20 or later
     If you are using an older RPM-based system which does not meet this
     minimum requirement (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4), then you can
     build pkgconfig 0.20 from the Fedora 5 source RPM:
     http://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/5/source/SRPMS/pkgconfig-0.20-2.2.1.src.rpm

-- If building Xvnc or building TigerVNC from the subversion repository:
   * autoconf 2.57 or later
   * automake 1.7 or later
   * libtool 1.4 or later

   * gettext 0.14.4 or later
     If you are using an older RPM-based system which does not meet this
     minimum requirement (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4), then you can
     build gettext 0.14.5 from the Fedora 5 source RPM:
     http://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/5/source/SRPMS/gettext-0.14.5-3.src.rpm
     NOTE: gcj and libgcj are required when building the above source RPM.


==================
Out-of-Tree Builds
==================

Binary objects, libraries, and executables are generated in the same directory
from which configure was executed (the "binary directory"), and this directory
need not necessarily be the same as the TigerVNC source directory.  You can
create multiple independent binary directories, in which different versions of
TigerVNC can be built from the same source tree using different compilers or
settings.  In the sections below, {build_directory} refers to the binary
directory, whereas {source_directory} refers to the TigerVNC source directory.
For in-tree builds, these directories are the same.


=================
Building TigerVNC
=================

The following procedure will build the TigerVNC Viewer on Linux and Unix
systems.  On 64-bit systems, this may build a 32-bit version of TigerVNC,
depending on the default autotools configuration for your system.  See below
for specific build instructions for 64-bit systems.

  cd {source_directory}
  autoreconf -fiv
  cd {build_directory}
  sh {source_directory}/configure [additional configure flags]
  make

NOTE: Running autoreconf in the source directory is only necessary if building
TigerVNC from the SVN repository.

Building the TigerVNC Server (Xvnc) is a bit trickier.  On newer systems, such
as Fedora, Xvnc is typically built to use the X11 shared libraries provided
with the system.  This requires a system with Xorg 7.4 or later, however.
Systems with older versions of Xorg must build a "legacy-friendly" version of
the TigerVNC Server.  This is accomplished by downloading and building the
more recent Xorg modules in a local directory and then building Xvnc such that
it links against the local build of these libraries, not the X11 libraries
installed on the system.  The "build-xorg" script in the TigerVNC source
distribution (located under unix/) automates this process.

The following procedure will build both the TigerVNC Viewer and a
"legacy-friendly" version of the TigerVNC Server:

  cd {build_directory}
  sh {source_directory}/unix/build-xorg init -version 7.4
  sh {source_directory}/unix/build-xorg build -version 7.4 [-static] [additional configure flags]

Passing an argument of "-static" to the build command line will generate a
version of Xvnc that has no external dependencies on the X11 shared libraries
or any other distribution-specific shared libraries.  This version of Xvnc
should be transportable across multiple O/S distributions.  The legacy-friendly
build should work on Red Hat Enterprise 4, its contemporaries, and later
systems.  It probably will not work on older systems.  It has not been tested
on non-Linux systems (yet).

build-xorg can also be used to rebuild just the TigerVNC Server and Viewer,
once the X11 modules and other dependencies have been built the first time.
This is convenient for testing changes that just apply to the TigerVNC source
code.  To accomplish this, run:

  sh {source_directory}/unix/build-xorg rebuild [additional make flags]

For instance,

  sh {source_directory}/unix/build-xorg rebuild clean

will clean both the Xvnc and vncviewer builds without destroying any of the
build configuration or module dependencies.


====================
Building TLS support
====================

VeNCrypt (the TigerVNC security and authentication extensions) can be built
with TLS support, which provides built-in encryption for VNC sessions.  This
requires GnuTLS, which is not pre-installed on all platforms.  In general, if
you are building on a Unix-ish platform that has the GnuTLS libraries and
include files installed in the standard system locations, then the TigerVNC
build system should detect the system version of GnuTLS automatically and link
against it.  However, this produces a version of TigerVNC that depends on the
GnuTLS dynamic libraries, and thus the TigerVNC binaries are not portable.

To build a fully portable, cross-compatible version of TigerVNC with VeNCrypt
support, it is necessary to link against the GnuTLS static library (as well
as the static libraries of its dependencies.)  If you are lucky enough, your
O/S distribution may include pre-packaged versions of these static libraries.
Otherwise, it will probably be necessary to build GnuTLS, libgcrypt, libtasn1,
and libgpg-error from source.

You can manipulate the GNUTLS_CFLAGS and GNUTLS_LDFLAGS configure variables to
accommodate a custom build of GnuTLS that is installed in a non-system
directory.  For instance, adding

  GNUTLS_CFLAGS=-I/opt/gnutls/include \
    GNUTLS_LDFLAGS='/opt/gnutls/lib/libgnutls.a /opt/gnutls/lib/libgcrypt.a \
    /opt/gnutls/lib/libgpg-error.a /opt/gnutls/lib/libtasn1.a' \
    --with-included-zlib

to the configure or 'build-xorg build' command line will cause TigerVNC to be
statically linked against a custom installation of GnuTLS that resides under
/opt/gnutls.  GnuTLS depends on zlib, so specifying --with-included-zlib will
satisfy that dependency using TigerVNC's in-tree version of zlib, which
prevents TigerVNC from depending on the libz dynamic library.

*******************************************************************************
**     Building on Windows (Visual C++ or MinGW)
*******************************************************************************


==================
Build Requirements
==================

-- CMake (http://www.cmake.org) v2.6 or later

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 or later

   If you don't already have Visual C++, then the easiest way to get it is by
   installing the Windows SDK:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx

   The Windows SDK includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ compilers and
   everything necessary to build TigerVNC.

   * For 32-bit builds, you can also use Microsoft Visual C++ Express
     Edition.  Visual C++ Express Edition is a free download.
   * If you intend to build TigerVNC from the command line, then add the
     appropriate compiler and SDK directories to the INCLUDE, LIB, and PATH
     environment variables.  This is generally accomplished by executing
     vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat and SetEnv.cmd.  vcvars32.bat and
     vcvars64.bat are part of Visual C++ and are located in the same directory
     as the compiler.  SetEnv.cmd is part of the Windows SDK.  You can pass
     optional arguments to SetEnv.cmd to specify a 32-bit or 64-bit build
     environment.

... OR ...

-- MinGW

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TigerVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php.
   You also need the Inno Setup Preprocessor, which is available in the
   Inno Setup QuickStart Pack.

   Add the directory containing iscc.exe (for instance, 
   C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5) to the system or user PATH environment
   variable prior to building TigerVNC.

-- If building TLS support:
   * GnuTLS and its dependencies (libgcrypt, libtasn1, libgpg-error)


==================
Out-of-Tree Builds
==================

Binary objects, libraries, and executables are generated in the same directory
from which cmake was executed (the "binary directory"), and this directory need
not necessarily be the same as the TigerVNC source directory.  You can create
multiple independent binary directories, in which different versions of
TigerVNC can be built from the same source tree using different compilers or
settings.  In the sections below, {build_directory} refers to the binary
directory, whereas {source_directory} refers to the TigerVNC source directory.
For in-tree builds, these directories are the same.


=================
Building TigerVNC
=================


Visual C++ (Command Line)
-------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release {source_directory}
  nmake

This will build either a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of TigerVNC, depending
on which version of cl.exe is in the PATH.


Visual C++ (IDE)
----------------

Choose the appropriate CMake generator option for your version of Visual Studio
(run "cmake" with no arguments for a list of available generators.)  For
instance:

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" {source_directory}

You can then open ALL_BUILD.vcproj in Visual Studio and build one of the
configurations in that project ("Debug", "Release", etc.) to generate a full
build of TigerVNC.


MinGW
-----

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" {source_directory}
  make

This will generate only vncviewer.  Currently, Visual C++ must be used to build
WinVNC.


Debug Build
-----------

Add "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" to the CMake command line.  Or, if building with
NMake, remove "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" (Debug builds are the default with
NMake.)


Self-Contained MinGW Build
--------------------------

If TigerVNC is built using MinGW, then it may depend on the MinGW libgcc DLL.
To eliminate this dependency, add

  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-static-libgcc -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-static-libgcc

to the CMake command line.


====================
Building TLS support
====================

VeNCrypt (the TigerVNC security and authentication extensions) can be built
with TLS support, which provides built-in encryption for VNC sessions.  This
requires GnuTLS, which is not Microsoft-friendly.  This section describes the
issues associated with building a Windows version of TigerVNC with TLS support
and how to work around those issues.

Building with MinGW
-------------------

An installer containing the GnuTLS header files, as well as static and dynamic
link libraries for 32-bit MinGW, can be downloaded from the following site:

http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/

As of this writing, GnuTLS cannot be built cleanly with MinGW64 due to the fact
that portions of the code assume an LP64 data model (Windows uses LLP64.)
Thus, it is not possible at this time to produce a Win64 version of TigerVNC
with TLS support.

Whether you use the above installer or build GnuTLS from source, make sure that
you install the libraries and headers into a pathname that doesn't contain
spaces (the installer will try to install under c:\Program Files unless you
tell it otherwise.)  If the GnuTLS include path contains spaces, then the MinGW
resource compiler will barf when you try to build TigerVNC.

You can manipulate the GNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR and GNUTLS_LIBRARY CMake variables to
specify the directory under which you installed GnuTLS.  For instance, adding

  -DGNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR=/c/gnutls/include \
    -DGNUTLS_LIBRARY=/c/gnutls/lib/libgnutls.dll.a

to the CMake command line when using MinGW will cause TigerVNC to be linked
against GnuTLS DLLs that are installed under c:\gnutls.

Adding

  -DGNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR=/c/gnutls/include \
    -DGNUTLS_LIBRARY='/c/gnutls/lib/libgnutls.a;/c/gnutls/lib/libgcrypt.a;/c/gnutls/lib/libtasn1.a;/c/gnutls/lib/libgpg-error.a'

to the CMake command line will cause TigerVNC to be statically linked against
GnuTLS libraries that are installed under c:\gnutls.

Note that the use of MinGW means that only the TigerVNC viewer can be built,
not the server.

Visual C++
----------

There is generally no sane way to build GnuTLS and its dependencies using
Visual C++.  Thus, it is necessary to either build the libraries with MinGW (or
download 32-bit versions of these from the link above), generate Visual C++
import libraries from the DLLs, then link TigerVNC against the Visual C++
import libraries.

In the instructions below, {gnutls_path} indicates the path under which GnuTLS
is installed (Example: c:\Program Files\GnuTLS-2.10.1).

To generate Visual C++ import libraries:

cd {gnutls_path}\lib
lib /def:..\bin\libgnutls-{version}.def /out:libgnutls.lib

Now, you can add the following arguments to the CMake command line:

  -DGNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR={gnutls_path}\include \
    -DGNUTLS_LIBRARY={gnutls_path}\lib\libgnutls.lib

to build TigerVNC against the GnuTLS DLLs installed under {gnutls_path}.


===================
Installing TigerVNC
===================

You can use the build system to install TigerVNC into a directory of your
choosing (as opposed to creating an installer.)  To do this, add:

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={install_directory}

to the CMake command line.

For example,

  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:\TigerVNC {source_directory}
  nmake install

If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, then the default is
c:\Program Files\TigerVNC.

64-bit MinGW Build on Cygwin
----------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    RC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib {source_directory}
  make

This produces a 64-bit build of TigerVNC that does not depend on cygwin1.dll or
other Cygwin DLL's.  The mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core and mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++
packages (and their dependencies) must be installed.


32-bit MinGW Build on Cygwin
----------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    RC=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-windres \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DDCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib {source_directory}
  make

This produces a 32-bit build of TigerVNC that does not depend on cygwin1.dll or
other Cygwin DLL's.  The mingw64-i686-gcc-core and mingw64-i686-gcc-g++
packages (and their dependencies) must be installed.


MinGW-w64 Build on Windows
--------------------------

This produces a 64-bit build of TigerVNC using the "native" MinGW-w64 toolchain
(which is faster than the Cygwin version):

  cd {build_directory}
  CC={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
    CXX={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    RC={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres \
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" \
    -DCMAKE_AR={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib \
    {source_directory}
  make


MinGW Build on Linux
--------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-gcc \
    CXX={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-g++ \
    RC={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-windres \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DCMAKE_AR={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-ranlib \
    {source_directory}
  make


*******************************************************************************
**     Creating Release Packages
*******************************************************************************

The following commands can be used to create various types of release packages:


Unix
----

make tarball

  Create a binary tarball containing the TigerVNC Viewer

make servertarball

  Create a binary tarball containing both the TigerVNC Server and Viewer

make dmg

  Create Macintosh package/disk image.  This requires the PackageMaker
  application, which must be installed in /Developer/Applications/Utilities.

make udmg [BUILDDIR32={32-bit build directory}]

  On 64-bit OS X systems, this creates a version of the Macintosh package and
  disk image which contains universal i386/x86-64 binaries.  You should first
  configure a 32-bit out-of-tree build of TigerVNC, then configure a 64-bit
  out-of-tree build, then run 'make udmg' from the 64-bit build directory.  The
  build system will look for the 32-bit build under {source_directory}/osxx86
  by default, but you can override this by setting the BUILDDIR32 variable on
  the make command line as shown above.  Either the 64-bit or 32-bit build can
  be configured to be backward-compatible by using the instructions in the
  "Unix Build Recipes" section.


Windows
-------

If using NMake:

  cd {build_directory}
  nmake installer

If using MinGW:

  cd {build_directory}
  make installer

If using the Visual Studio IDE, build the "installer" project.

The installer package (TigerVNC[64].exe) will be located under
{build_directory}.  If building using the Visual Studio IDE, then the installer
package will be located in a subdirectory with the same name as the
configuration you built (such as {build_directory}\Debug\ or
{build_directory}\Release\).

NOTE:  If TigerVNC is built with TLS support, then the build system will
attempt to package the GnuTLS DLLs into the Windows installer.  It looks for
these DLLs in a directory called "bin" one level up from GNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR.
