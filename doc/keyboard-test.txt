Test protocol for keyboard handling
===================================

Platform specific tests/issues are marked with [].

These tests are primarily about what is sent over the protocol and some
may be difficult or impossible to test using normal applications. In
these cases you can turn on debug logging in either the client or the
server by specifying "-Log *:stderr:100".

We currently have a limitation in Xvnc where it can run out of symbols,
resulting in nothing being sent to the applications. Just run setxkbmap
with any layout to reset the symbol table.

Client
------

- Normal symbols:

  - ASCII characters
  - Latin 1 character
  - Unicode BMP characters
  - Unicode non-BMP characters (does any layout actually have these?)

- Dead keys:

  These are not available on a single layout, so you need to switch to
  test everything. The useful layouts also differ per platform:

    X11: US International for most, Greek for some specific diacretics
    Win: US International, Czech, Greek Polytonic, Vietnamese
    OS X: ABC Extended (FIXME: lots of broken keys),
          Greek (FIXME: cannot be used with TigerVNC)

  - Grave
  - Acute
  - Circumflex
  - Tilde
  - Macron (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - Breve
  - Dot above
  - Dot below
  - Diaeresis
  - Ring above
  - Double acute
  - Caron
  - Cedilla
  - Ogonek
  - Ypogegrammeni (iota below) (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - Dialytika tonos [Win] (Diaresis on X11, and maybe OS X?)
  - Comma above (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - Reversed comma above (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - Horn [X11?]
  - Hook above [Win?]
  - Hook below [X11?, Win?]
  - Dakuten (Katakana voiced mark) (Only Input Methods layouts?)
  - Handakuten (Katakana semi-voiced mark) (Only Input Methods layouts?)
  - FIXME: Many more that we currently probably don't support

  - No composition on client

- Modifiers:

  X11: You can usually toggle Hyper/Super and Compose/Scroll_Lock using
       XKB options.

  - CapsLock, NumLock (sent but ignored by server)
  - Shift, Ctrl
  - Alt, AltGr, Super [Win, X11] (FIXME: AltGr broken on Win)
  - Meta [X11]
  - Left/right identification (FIXME: broken for Shift on Win)
  - CmdL => AltL, CmdR => SuperL, AltL => ModeSwitch, AltR => Level3Shift [OS X]
  - Hyper sends Super [X11]

  - CapsLock, Shift and AltGr affect symbol lookup
  - Ctrl does not affect symbol lookup
  - CtrlL+AltR is fake released to compensate for Windows' AltGr magic [Win]
  - Ctrl+Alt+<ANY> sends the same symbol as <ANY> (note behaviour above though)
  - Ctrl+AltGr+<ANY> sends the same symbol as AltGr+<ANY> (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - "Shift press, A press, Shift release, A release" should not send "a release"

- Numpad:

  - NumLock affects symbol lookup [Win, X11]
  - Numpad specific symbols are sent
  - Decimal key should send Decimal for layouts with . as a symbol, and
    Separator for layouts with , as a symbol
  - Shift inverts NumLock behaviour [X11]
  - Shift turns NumLock off, but not on [Win] (FIXME: fake Shifts also sent)

- Multimedia keys:

  OS X: FIXME: all broken

  - Back, Forward, Refresh, Stop
  - HomePage, Search, Favourites (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - Mail, Calculator
  - Volume up, down, mute
  - Media next, previous, stop, play
  - Sleep (FIXME: broken on Win)
  - FIXME: probably more keys exist

- Non-character keys:

  - F1-F24 (FIXME: F14-F15 broken on OS X)
  - Tab, Space, Backspace, Return, Esc
  - LeftTab sends Tab [X11?]
  - PrntScrn, ScrollLock, Pause [X11, Win]
  - Help [X11?, OS X]
  - Insert [X11, Win]
  - Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown
  - Arrow keys
  - Menu
  - Alt+PrntScrn sends Sys_Req [Win]

- French layout (AZERTY and inverted shift behaviour for many keys)

- Key repeat should not send repeated release events

- Keys are released on loss of focus

- Local layout changes are respected

- Local input methods are disabled/enabled with focus

- System keys should be grabbed in full screen (FIXME: lots missing on Win)

  The exact keys depends on the system and configuration, but it
  is usually variants of these:

  - Alt+Tab
  - Super (and Super+other)
  - Multimedia keys
  - Ctrl+Alt+Delete
  - Ctrl+Esc
  - F8-F12

- Virtual keyboard (as much of the above as is possible)
