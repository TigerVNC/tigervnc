Changes since version 0.1.50:

          Hundreds of thousands of connections had caused that exception.
- bugfix: resource leaks at the failure of making local port forwarding. FIXED.
- bugfix: NPE in connecting to the non-standard TCP port.  FIXED.
          This problem had appeared if a host-key does not exist in
	  "known_host" file.
- bugfix: TCP connection may not be dropped if error messages from
	  the remote are too long.                          FIXED.
- bugfix: SftpATTRS#getAtimeString() returns the wrong string. FIXED.
- bugfix: bytes to be added by SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST must be in
	  unsigned integer. FIXED.
- bugfix: Util#checkTilde() should not convert a tilde in
          "C:\PROGRA~1\". FIXED.
- bugfix: A long long command for ChannelExec will cause
          an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. FIXED.
- bugfix: ChannelSftp should not send bulk request greedily even if the remote
          window has the enough space.  FIXED.
- bugfix: Util.createSocket() should throw an exception with 'cause'. FIXED.
- bugfix: failed to parse .ssh/config in the EBCDIC environment. FIXED.
- bugfix: com.jcraft.jsch.jcraft.HMACSHA1(used only for MacOSX) is not
          reusable.  FIXED.
- bugfix: NPE caused by the delayed response for channel opening
          requests. FIXED.
- bugfix: hung-up in uploading huge data to ProFTPd without the config
          'SFTPClientMatch "JSCH.*" channelWindowSize 1GB'  FIXED.
- bugfix: Cipher#init() may cause an infinite loop with 100% cpu use due to
          https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8028627  FIXED.
- bugfix: in some case, JSche#setKnowHosts(InputStream stream) may fail
          to close the given stream.  FIXED
- change: com.jcraft.jsch.jcraft.HMAC* will not be used.
          It seems Java6 on Mac OS X has fixed some memory leak bug in JCE,
